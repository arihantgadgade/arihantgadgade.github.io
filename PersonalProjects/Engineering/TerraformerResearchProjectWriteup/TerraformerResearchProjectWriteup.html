            <strong>Terraformer Overview:</strong> <br>
            The Terraformer is a machine that capture carbon dioxide and produces methane. <br>
            <br>
            The Terraformer is comprised of 3 subunits: <br>
            1. Direct Air Carbon Capture system <br>
            2. Electrolyzer <br>
            3. Methanation <br>
            <br>

            The carbon capture unit is what's responsible for combatting climate change
            by removing CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. <br>
            <br>
            The electrolyzer creates the hydrogen gas from water necessary for the "hydro"
            in hydrocarbons. <br>
            <br>
            Methanation is the money maker, this is where we take CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>
            and turn them into our useful CH<sub>4</sub> product. Thus, allowing us to successfully
            monetize carbon capture, not to mention this will be cheaper than current methods of 
            methane production. <br>
            <br>

            <strong>Project Overview:</strong> <br>
            I will be covering the science and processes of each of the subunits. I will be focusing my efforts 
            on the carbon capture system, as that is the subunit I will build and do experiments with.

            2.1. Purpose
            <a href="#contents">üîù</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Direct air capture (DAC) is how we are performing carbon capture. 
            We need carbon dioxide and hydrogen to create the methane, and thus this
            DAC is used to get the CO<sub>2</sub>.
        </p>

            2.2. Overview of Science and Processes
            <a href="#contents">üîù</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Simply: air goes in, then CO<sub>2</sub> from the air is removed,
            the rest of the air leaves, and the captured CO<sub>2</sub>
            is sent for methanation. <br>
            Breaking this into parts: <br>
            1. Air goes in: achieved with fans <br>
            2. CO<sub>2</sub> from the air is removed: carbonation using calcium hydroxide <br>
            3. Captured CO<sub>2</sub> is sent for methanation: calcination using kilns <br>
            Steps 2 and 3 are part of the lime cycle. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Lime Cycle:</strong> <br>
            <img src="TRPWAssets/The_lime_cycle.jpg" alt="limecycle">
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0kZXFvI4kCU?si=_Joz-eVyRmJl8Meo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br>
            The lime cycle is useful for understanding calcium looping which is the backbone of our DAC. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Calcium Looping:</strong> <br>
            <code>Slaking: CaO(s) + H<sub>2</sub>O(g) -> Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>(s) &Delta;H = -110.2 kJ/mol</code> [enthalpy change calculated using standard enthalpy of formation sourced from the Wikipedia page of each of these compounds]<br>
            <code>Carbonation: Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>(s) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g) -> CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) + H<sub>2</sub>O(g) &Delta;H = -68.3 kJ/mol</code> <br>
            <code>Calcination: CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) -> CaO(s) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g) &Delta;H = +178.5 kJ/mol</code> <br>
            This resulting CaO is then looped back into the first reaction,
            and the process repeats. <br>
            <br>
            Should be noted that CaO degrades over time:
            <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360128509000574?via%3Dihub">source</a> <br>
            So, as the CaO is not infinitely reusable, this must be accounted for in the design of the DAC. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Sorbents:</strong> <br>
            The process of carbonation uses calcium hydroxide as a sorbent for absorbing carbon dioxide. <br>
            <br>
            Map of sorption: <br>
            Sorption: process by which one substance becomes attached to another <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;- Adsorption: substance taken up by the surface of another <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Physisorption <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Chemisorption <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;- Absorption: substance taken up by the bulk phase of another <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Physical Absorption <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Chemical Absorption <br>
            <br>
            In this map, carbonation using calcium hydroxide is under chemical absorption.
            Carbon dioxide is taken up by the bulk phase of the calcium hydroxide, in turn producing
            calcium carbonate and water. Our DAC system will have to facilitate this absorption, which
            we'll do with a fluidized bed. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Kilns:</strong> <br>
            Let's look at the temperature needed to run the calcination.
            To do this we'll use the Gibbs free energy. <br>
            <code>&Delta;G&deg; = &Delta;H&deg; - T&Delta;S&deg;</code> <br>
            We already have the enthalpy change of the reaction (+178.5 kJ/mol),
            we only need the entropy change. <br>
            <code>&Delta;S = (40 + 214) - 93 J/(K*mol) = 161 J/(K*mol)</code> [Std molar entropy sourced from wiki]<br>
            Solving for equilibrium temp: <br>
            <code>&Delta;G&deg; &le; 0 &rArr; T<sub>eq</sub>=&Delta;H&deg;/&Delta;S&deg; = 178000/161 = 1109 K = 836&deg;C</code> <br>
            Thus, the temperature to run the kiln for calcination is: <br>
            <code>T &ge; 836&deg;C</code> <br>
            We'll probably want to run the kilns at 850-900&deg;C for a healthy driving force.
            However, running above 950&deg;C will contribute to sintering, decreasing the life of our sorbent. <br>
            <br>
            Let's look at the kilns they are using:
            <blockquote>
                "In the kiln area we have 5 kW and 15 kW commercial grade pottery kilns, as well as a production prototype 60 kW calcination oven (‚Äúthe toaster‚Äù). Its design differs substantially from the kilns as its material can be contained in long, flat shapes that have better heat transfer properties."
            </blockquote>

            Ok, so now we've went over the science we can start trying to design the system.
            They gave an overview of the calcium concentration cycle in their
            first whitepaper (so their design might've changed), and I'll base the schematics off that.

            In this diagram we see the humidifier, CO<sub>2</sub> absorption bed, dehydrator, and calciner.
            The humidifier can arguably be incorporated into the absorption bed. The processes we see from the
            lime cycle (calcium looping) are the calcination in the calciner and the slaking and carbonation simultaneously in
            the CO<sub>2</sub> absorption bed. We can also see this unit's rxns are not 1:1 with the lime cycle we discussed
            earlier. <br>
            <br>
            I haven't included it, but there should also be some mechanism for new calcium carbonate to be fed in as the calcium oxide
            degrades. <br>

            <br>
            They stated this cycle can be performed with continuous or batch material processing machinery,
            but for these purposes I am considering this as a continuous reactor. The calciner and pre-calciner subunits
            behave as plug-flow reactors, and the absortion bed behaves as a fluidized-bed reactor. Thus, the whole unit is acting
            as a continuous reactor.<br>

            2.4. Experiment
            <a href="#contents">üîù</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
            I had the idea to create a mini carbon capture unit, as the fundamental chemical rxns are quite
            simple. I initially considered just making a mini fluidized bed, but figured that would be overkill for
            a first attempt, and decided to just try to do simple carbonation of calcium hydroxide with the captured air. In researching 
            this, I found there were some open source attempts at doing so, one that stood out was
            <a href="">OpenAir Cyan</a>
            by Dahl Winters. Cyan uses the similar chemical rxn I was planning on doing. While researching, I saw that
            to facilitate the rxn, having the relative humidity be high allowed faster rxn rates. I was considering
            using a humidifier (steam or ultrasonic) and fan system, but found Cyan's approach to be quite good. Cyan
            uses an aquarium bubbler and airstone in a reservoir of water to increase the humidity. This solution was
            quite useful because the bubbler diffuses the captured air and water into the unit's air, which allows me to 
            not have to worry about the fan system (unless I cared about drying).

        <p>
            <strong>Analysis:</strong> <br>
            First, we want to find out how much CO<sub>2</sub> was captured. <br>
            <br>
            To start, here's the rxn governing the CO<sub>2</sub> uptake: <br>
            <code>Carbonation: Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>(s) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g) -> CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) + H<sub>2</sub>O(g)</code> <br>
            Analyzing this rxn necessitates calculating molar mass: <br>
            <code>Calcium atomic mass: 40.08u</code> <br>
            <code>Oxygen atomic mass: 15.999u</code> <br>
            <code>Hydrogen atomic mass: 1.008u</code> <br>
            <code>Carbon atomic mass: 12.011u</code> <br>
            <code>Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> molar mass: 1*(40.08) + 2*(15.999 + 1.008) = 74.094 g/mol</code><br>
            <code>CO<sub>2</sub> molar mass: 1*(12.011) + 2*(15.999) = 44.009 g/mol</code><br>
            <code>CaCO<sub>3</sub> molar mass: 1*(40.08) + 1*(12.011) + 3*(15.999) = 100.088 g/mol</code> <br>
            <code>H<sub>2</sub>O molar mass: 2*(1.008) + 1*(15.999) = 18.015 g/mol</code> <br>
            Gain in solid mass: <br>
            <code>(CaCO<sub>3</sub> molar mass) - (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> molar mass): 100.088 - 74.094 = 25.994 g/mol</code><br>
            Each mole of rxn also consumes one mole of CO<sub>2</sub>, so we can find a ratio to measure CO<sub>2</sub> uptake: <br>
            <code>(CO<sub>2</sub> molar mass) / (Gain in solid mass): 44.009 / 25.994 = 1.693</code> <br>
            Thus, for every gram of gain in solid mass, 1.693g of CO<sub>2</sub> is uptaken. <br>
            <br>
            <u>So, we uptook 1.271g of CO<sub>2</sub> because we had a solid mass change of .751g.</u> <br>
            <br>
            Theoretical CO2 capture: <br>
            Solid mass ratio: <br>
            <code>(CaCO<sub>3</sub> molar mass) / (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> molar mass) = 100.088 / 74.094 = 1.351</code> <br>
            Thus, now we can see what the theoretical CaCO<sub>3</sub> weight will be if all the Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> reacts: <br>
            <code>5g Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> * 1.351 = 6.754g CaCO<sub>3</sub></code> <br>
            So we have a solid mass change of 1.754g, thus the theoretical mass of CO<sub>2</sub> to be uptaken is: <br>
            <code>Theoretical CO<sub>2</sub> uptake: 1.754g * 1.693 = 2.97g CO<sub>2</sub></code> <br>
            Comparing that to the experimental CO<sub>2</sub> uptake: <br>
            <code>1.27 / 2.97 = 42.7%</code> <br>
            Thus an efficiency of 42.7% was achieved.<br>
            <br>
            Now let's compare the carbon we uptook to the amount used in electricity to run the air pump.
            This allows us to analyze whether we are carbon negative or not. <br>
            <code>Air pump electric usage: 2.9W</code> <br>
            <code>Hours air pump ran: 6 hr</code> <br>
            Thus: <br>
            <code>Total electrical energy used: 17.4 Wh</code> <br>
            Calculating the CO<sub>2</sub> used for this electricity: <br>
            <code>Total output (baseload) emission rate: 893.3 (lb CO<sub>2</sub>/MWh)</code> [<a href="https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references">source</a>] <br>
            Converting it to g/Wh: <br>
            <code>Total output (baseload) emission rate: 0.405 (g CO<sub>2</sub>/Wh)</code> <br>
            Thus the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> used running this DAC was: <br>
            <code>17.4 Wh * 0.405 (g CO<sub>2</sub>/Wh) = 7.047g CO<sub>2</sub></code> <br>
            Thus comparing this to the 1.27g of CO<sub>2</sub> captured we are not net negative carbon.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Discussion:</strong> <br>
            I believe an easy way I could have optimized this to get to net negative would be to
            make a bigger DAC (allowing for more calcium hydroxide to be carbonated) or run the
            air pump for much less time. Running the air pump for less time is achievable by having
            a relative humidity sensor regulating the usage of the air pump.
            They had a kiln at my school (in the material science makerspace), but it was unavailable,
            otherwise I could try to calcinate the powder and capture the CO<sub>2</sub>. <br>

            Considering how the majority of the energy demand for the Terraformer comes from
            the electrolyzer, and the goals of TI are to solve climate change profitably, it may
            be worthwhile to looking into cracking CO<sub>2</sub>. Cracking CO<sub>2</sub> gives
            us the elemental carbon and oxygen. Carbon is quite useful, so if we could find a way
            to economically produce carbon from captured CO<sub>2</sub>, then we've found a way to make a
            profitable carbon negative process, as opposed to just the carbon neutrality of the
            current Terraformer. However CO<sub>2</sub> is quite stable, so further analysis is needed.

            The basic idea of electrolysis of water is producing hydrogen and oxygen gas
            by splitting water using electricty. Overall chemical equation: <br>
            <code>2H<sub>2</sub>O(l) -> 2H<sub>2</sub>(g) + O<sub>2</sub>(g)</code> <br>
            <br>
            We get to electrolysis from redox rxns and electrochemistry:

            <strong>Water Electrolysis:</strong> <br>
            Taking a look at the annotated redox rxn of water electrolysis:
            <img src="TRPWAssets/waterelectrolysisrxn.png">
            Let's try to find the voltage necessary for running this rxn.
            To do so we'll look at reduction potentials. Note that we're assuming an
            alkaline water electrolysis stack with potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte. <br>
            <br>
            Basic diagram of alkaline water electrolysis:
            <img src="TRPWAssets/waterelectrolysisdiag.jpg">

            Water electrolysis eqns from a table of standard electrode potentials from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_electrode_potential_(data_page)">Wikipedia</a>: 
            <img src="TRPWAssets/stdep.png">
            Using this we see the necessary voltage for water electrolysis. Eqn1 
            determines the cathodic H<sub>2</sub> half rxn, eqn2 
            determines the anodic O<sub>2</sub> half rxn. The reduction potentials of both
            allow us to determine the standard cell potential in eqn3 as 1.23V. <br>
            <br>
            1.23V is the thermodynamic minimum cell voltage for splitting pure liquid water
            into H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> in the standard state (298 K, 1 bar). In practice,
            a higher voltage is needed. <br>
            <br>
            
            <strong>Electrolyzer Model/Experiment:</strong> <br>
            Ok now we've got an idea of the science behind alkaline water electrolysis,
            how do we build a practical model? <br>
            <img src="TRPWAssets/simplewaterelectrolysisexp.png">
            We've diagrammed a very simple alkaline water electrolysis experiment above, and I will
            explain the components now: <br>
            - Container: must be resistant to caustics <br>
            - Electrolyte solution: water with dissolved KOH, giving lots of free K<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>-</sup> ions <br>
            - Electrodes: nickel cathode and anode <br>
            - Battery: 9V battery attached with leads to the electrodes<br>
            <br>
            As soon as one connects the battery, the circuit closes, electrons
            flow from negative terminal to cathode to anode then back into positive terminal. Thus: <br>
            1. At the cathode electrons flow into the water, water molecules around the cathode
            pick up electrons and splits into hydrogen gas and hydroxide ions: <br>
            <code>2H<sub>2</sub>O + 2e<sup>-</sup> -> H<sub>2</sub>(g) + 2OH<sup>-</sup></code> <br>
            Thus we see hydrogen bubbles rising off the cathode. <br>
            2. At the anode electrons are pulled out of the solution, hydroxide ions give up
            electrons and combine to form oxygen gas and water: <br>
            <code>4OH<sup>-</sup> -> O<sub>2</sub>(g) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O  + 4e<sup>-</sup></code> <br>
            Thus we see oxygen bubbles rising off the anode. <br>
            <br>
            Hence we get the overall eqn: <br>
            <code>2H<sub>2</sub>O(l) -> 2H<sub>2</sub>(g) + O<sub>2</sub>(g)</code> <br>

            <br>
            And then we can add in a diaphragm between the electrodes to allow the electrolysis to
            take place while seperating the hydrogen and oxygen gases. This porous diaphragm
            does so by allowing the OH<sup>-</sup> ions migrate to carry the current, but blocks the
            hydrogen and oxygen gas from mixing.
            <img src="TRPWAssets/simplewaterelectrolysisexp2.png">
            Thus, now we can capture the hydrogen gas.

        <p>
            The Sabatier Reaction occurs when carbon dioxide and hydrogen
            react to produce methane and water. This reaction takes place
            at 400&deg;C, 3MPa, and in the presence of a nickel catalyst.<br>
            <br>

            The exact mechanism by which the Sabatier Rxn acts is disagreed upon. <br>
            <br>

            Sabatier Rxn: <br>
            <code>CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> -> CH<sub>4</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O &Delta;H=-165 kJ/mol</code> <br>
            By the negative enthalpy, we see this is an exothermic rxn. <br>
            <br>

            The reaction takes place by way of catalytic hydrogenation of 
            CO<sub>2</sub>, thus reduction of CO<sub>2</sub>. <br>
            <br>

            Reduction Half Rxn: <br>
            <code>CO<sub>2</sub> + 8H<sup>+</sup> + 8e<sup>-</sup> -> CH<sub>4</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O</code> <br>
            Oxidation Half Rxn: <br>
            <code>4H<sub>2</sub> -> 8H<sup>+</sup> + 8e<sup>-</sup></code> <br>
            <br>

            <strong>Diagram of a Sabatier Reactor:</strong>
            <img src="TRPWAssets/SRdiag.png">
            1. Hydrogen and oxygen gas is fed into a Mass Flow Controller (MFC) <br>
            2. MFC to set H<sub>2</sub>:CO<sub>2</sub> ratio at 4:1, then pressurizes it to 3MPa<br>
            3. The reactor is a fixed bed tube with nickel catalyst. Heating system lets reaction take place
            at 400&deg;C. <br>
            4. Condenser rapidly cools the hot reactor effluent, thus seperating steam from methane by turning
            the steam into liquid water. <br>
            5. The gas that exits the sabatier reactor is done so such that it is stored properly. Gas analysis
            can be done with gas chromatograph.
