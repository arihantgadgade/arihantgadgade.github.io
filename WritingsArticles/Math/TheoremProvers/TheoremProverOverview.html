        <h3>Automated Theorem Provers</h3>
        <h4>ATP Overview</h4>
        <p>
            There's plenty of good resources on ATPs so I will just show the vids that I like: <br>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/AayZuuDDKP0?si=bPLK7Yauv99u8P7U">Terence Tao, "Machine Assisted Proof"</a> <br>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/prYaTrZUces?si=xCMNtlEogcOk4k_j">Automated Mathematical Proofs - Computerphile</a> <br>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/mMaid2jYeEo?si=_54Kya-IDWyyLbAy">Automated Theorem Proving and Axiomatic Mathematics in Wolfram Language</a>
        </p>


        <h4>My WSS24 project dealing with ATP capabilities</h4>
        <a href="https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/3210817">WSS24 Project: Study "Logic Puzzle" axiom/proof graphs from TPTP.org</a>
        <p>
            Thanks to Wolfram's Live CEOing, while doing research for my project,
            I was able to find the livestream where Jonathan Gorard was showing the 
            Automated Theorem Proving capabilities he was building to Stephen. I was even 
            able to see the exact moment where Jonathan introduced TPTP to Stephen, which
            led to the inception of my WSS24 project.

            I found it quite funny that there's only a couple hundred views on this as of me watching it:

            The Wolfram ATP is designed off of the Waldmeister Theorem Prover. <br>
            Here's the research paper on the development of Waldmeister: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2239752_WALDMEISTER_Development_of_a_High_Performance_Completion--Based_Theorem_Prover">WALDMEISTER: Development of a High Performance Completion--Based Theorem Prover</a> <br>
            Here you can find a list of different theorem provers that have participated
            in the The CADE ATP System Competition: <a href="https://tptp.org/CASC/">The CADE ATP System Competition</a> <br>
        </p>


        <h3>Interactive Theorem Provers</h3>
        <p>
            Interactive Theorem Provers are also called Proof Assistants.
            One of the more famous of these is called Lean.<br>
            <br>
            Really great talk by Kevin Buzzard about Lean: <a href="https://youtu.be/Dp-mQ3HxgDE?si=wDs0TU66Y6GdaisD">The Future of Mathematics?</a> <br>
            Great site to play with Lean: <a href="https://adam.math.hhu.de/">Lean Game Server</a> <br>
            I recommend playing the Natural Number Game. <br>
            <br>
            I will probably end up doing more work in Lean, and will post here: <a href="LeanTP.html">Lean Theorem Proving</a> <br>
        </p>


        <h3>Concluding Remarks</h3>
        <p>
            I am very excited for the future of Theorem Proving, 
            I believe it to play a significant role in the future of Mathematics, if not being The Future of Math.
