Think I may place my articles here
- i was thinking about the categorization issue,
  as it would mess up the links if i decided to recategorize
- but if i just had a folder on here for all the articles,
  and then categorized them in the directory, it should be fine
  for the links

and perhaps i could do uncategorized 1, 2, 3...
- or do it like 2025 articles, 2026 articles, etc
