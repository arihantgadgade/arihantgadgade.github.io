            About Me

        <p>
            Interests are vast, but recurring themes are math, physics, computation.

        <p>
            Hosting this website on github pages has numerous benefits: cost, version control, everything is open source at <a href="https://github.com/arihantgadgade/arihantgadgade.github.io"> this github repo</a> for anyone to use.
        </p>
        <p>
            My website home has a directory-like minimalist structure that I very much enjoy. I adopted it from <a href="https://longestlevers.com/">Longest Levers</a>
        </p>
        <p>   
            Also articles within sections are generally ordered chronologically from oldest to newest.
            I prefer that to generally how blogs/substacks show the newest writings. I like building up the writer/creator 
            in my head from their oldest to newest writings.
