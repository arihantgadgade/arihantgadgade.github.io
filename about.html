            About Me
        </h4>
        <p>
            Interests are vast, but recurring themes are math, physics, computation.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Website Structure
        </h4>
        <p>
            Hosting this website on github pages has numerous benefits: cost, version control, everything is open source at <a href="https://github.com/arihantgadgade/arihantgadgade.github.io"> this github repo</a> for anyone to use.
        </p>
        <p>
            My website home has a directory-like minimalist structure that I very much enjoy. I adopted it from <a href="https://longestlevers.com/">Longest Levers</a>
        </p>
        <h4>
            Writings
        </h4>
        <p>   
            Articles are ordered two ways: chronologically and categorically.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chronologically from oldest to newest. I prefer that to generally how blogs/substacks show the newest writings. I like building up the writer/creator 
                in my head from their oldest to newest writings.</li>
            <li>Categorically they are given a definite category as opposed to being tagged with multiple categories, I prefer this just for the visual categorical structure.</li>
        </ul>
